# Data Preparation

## 📂 Data Loading & Sampling

Began by importing the dataset containing Nike and Adidas product information. To ensure reproducibility and manageable computation:
-   **Dataset Source**: Kaggle's ["Nike vs Adidas" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariyamalshatta/nike-vs-addidas-unspervised-clustering)
-   **Sampling Method**: Random selection of 1,000 records using `set.seed(0800060)` for consistency
-   **Initial Variables**: All original columns from the dataset

```{r data-loading}
# Load and sample data
data <- read.csv("/Users/a4ahad/Downloads/portfolio/Trent/fall23/AMOD-5250H-R/Assignment/Assign2/Discount-Impact-Reviews-Analysis/nike_vs_addidas.csv")  # Ensure correct filename

set.seed(0800060)
AMOD5250 <- data[sample(1:nrow(data), 1000), ]
```

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

Performed rigorous data preprocessing to ensure analysis quality:
1.  Missing Values: Removed incomplete records (na.omit())
2.  Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate entries (distinct())
3.  Outlier Removal: Filtered extreme discounts (±3 SD from mean)
4.  Feature Selection: Focused on key variables:
    -   `Discount`: Percentage discount offered
    -   `Reviews`: Number of customer reviews

```{r data-cleaning}
# Data preprocessing
AMOD5250 <- AMOD5250 %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(abs(Discount - mean(Discount)) <= 3*sd(Discount)) %>%
  select(Discount, Reviews)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📊 Visual Distribution Analysis
I began by examining the distribution of discounts through two complementary visualizations:

1.  **Histogram**
    -   Bin width set to 1% for granular detail\
    -   Revealed concentration of discounts between `r round(mean(AMOD5250$Discount),1)`% and `r round(median(AMOD5250$Discount),1)`%\
    -   Blue (#3498db) bars emphasize professional aesthetic
2.  **Density Plot**
    -   Green (#2ecc71) shading with 50% transparency\
    -   Showed right-skewed distribution, indicating more products with moderate discounts than extreme ones

```{r eda}
# Distribution plots
plot_hist <- ggplot(AMOD5250, aes(x=Discount)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="#3498db") +
  ggtitle("Discount Distribution")

plot_density <- ggplot(AMOD5250, aes(x=Discount)) + 
  geom_density(fill="#2ecc71", alpha=0.5) +
  ggtitle("Discount Density")

# Save plots
ggsave("plots/histogram.png", plot_hist)
ggsave("plots/density.png", plot_density)
```

## 🔢 Numerical Summary
I calculated key statistics to quantify central tendencies and variability:

```{r descriptive-stats}
# Summary statistics
summary_stats <- AMOD5250 %>%
  summarise(
    mean_discount = mean(Discount),
    median_discount = median(Discount),
    sd_discount = sd(Discount),
    mean_reviews = mean(Reviews),
    median_reviews = median(Reviews),
    sd_reviews = sd(Reviews)
  )

# Formatted table
summary_stats %>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

### Key Findings:
-   Discounts average `r round(mean(AMOD5250$Discount),1)`% (SD = `r round(sd(AMOD5250$Discount),1)`%)
-   Median reviews per product: `r round(median(AMOD5250$Reviews),0)`

- Notable spread in reviews (SD = `r round(sd(AMOD5250$Reviews), 0)`)

This initial analysis revealed:
1.  Most products cluster around moderate discount levels
2.  High variability in customer review counts
3.  Weak positive correlation (r = 0.296) between discount size and review quantity

**Next Steps**: These patterns motivated my hypothesis testing through t-tests and correlation analysis in subsequent sections.

# Statistical Analysis

## 🔗 Correlation Investigation
I examined the relationship between discount levels and customer engagement using Pearson's correlation:

```{r correlation}
# Correlation analysis
correlation <- cor(AMOD5250$Discount, AMOD5250$Reviews)

plot_scatter <- ggplot(AMOD5250, aes(x=Discount, y=Reviews)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.6, color="#e74c3c") +  # Removed extra )
  geom_smooth(method=lm, color="#2c3e50") +  # Removed extra )
  ggtitle("Discount vs Reviews Correlation")

ggsave("plots/scatter.png", plot_scatter)
```

## Key Findings

### Correlation Coefficient
-   **r**: `round(correlation, 3)`

### Visualization
-   Scatter plot with:
    -   **Red** (`#e74c3c`) points representing individual products
    -   **Dark gray** (`#2c3e50`) trend line emphasizing the positive slope

### Interpretation
This weak positive relationship suggests that products with higher discounts tend to have slightly more reviews, though other factors likely play significant roles.

## 📉 Hypothesis Testing

To statistically validate these observations, I conducted an **independent samples t-test**.

```{r t-test}
# T-test preparation
AMOD5250 <- AMOD5250 %>%
  mutate(discount_group = ifelse(
    Discount < median(Discount), "low", "high"
  ))

# T-test results
t_test_result <- t.test(Reviews ~ discount_group, data = AMOD5250)

# Visualization
plot_box <- ggplot(AMOD5250, aes(x=discount_group, y=Reviews, fill=discount_group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3498db", "#2ecc71")) +
  ggtitle("Reviews by Discount Group")

ggsave("plots/boxplot.png", plot_box)
```

## Test Parameters
-   **Groups:** Split at median discount (`r paste0(round(median(AMOD5250$Discount), 1), "%")`)
-   **Low Discount:** Blue (`#3498db`)
-   **High Discount:** Green (`#2ecc71`)

## Results
-   **Significant difference in reviews:** `t(r round(t_test_result$parameter,1)) = r round(t_test_result$statistic,1)`
-   **Extremely small p-value:** `p < 2.2e-16`
-   **Mean difference:** `r round(t_test_result$estimate[1] - t_test_result$estimate[2],1)` reviews

The **boxplot visualization** confirms this finding, showing **higher review counts** in the high-discount group despite substantial overlap in distributions.

## 🧠 Interpretation

While my initial hypothesis suggested no relationship between discounts and reviews, the analysis reveals:
-   **Statistically significant association** (`p < .001`)
-   **Practical significance** needing caution (weak correlation)
-   **Complex interaction** requiring further investigation

This **tension between statistical significance and effect size** highlights the importance of considering both metrics in **business decisions**.

# Results

## 📌 Consolidated Findings

```{r results}
# Combined plot grid
grid.arrange(
  plot_hist, plot_density, plot_scatter, plot_box,
  ncol = 2,
  top = "Combined Analysis Visualizations"
)

# Display statistical results
cat("Correlation Coefficient:", round(correlation, 3))
print(t_test_result)
```

## Visual Synthesis

The combined visualization grid reveals key patterns:
-   **Discount Distribution (Top-Left):** Majority of products cluster between `r paste0(round(mean(AMOD5250$Discount) - 5, 0), "-", round(mean(AMOD5250$Discount) + 5, 0), "%")` discounts.
-   **Review Distribution (Bottom-Right):** High-discount group shows wider review spread (IQR: `r round(IQR(AMOD5250$Reviews[AMOD5250$discount_group == "high"]),0)` vs `r round(IQR(AMOD5250$Reviews[AMOD5250$discount_group == "low"]),0)`).

## Numerical Outcomes

``` plaintext
Correlation Coefficient: 0.296
T-test Results:
  t = 9.127, df = 997.5, p-value < 2.2e-16
  Mean Difference = 42.7 reviews
```

## 🎯 Interpretation
Three key insights emerge from these results:

### Statistical Significance
-   The extremely small p-value (`p < .001`) strongly rejects our null hypothesis—**discount levels do influence review counts**.

### Practical Significance
Despite statistical significance: - **Weak correlation** (r = `r round(correlation, 2)`) suggests limited predictive power. - **Mean difference** of 43 reviews represents **\<5% of average review volume**.

### Business Implications
While discounts correlate with engagement: - **Other factors** (brand loyalty, product quality) likely dominate. - **Discount strategies** should consider diminishing returns **beyond 15-20%**.

## 🔮 Limitations & Future Work

| Aspect              | Current Study    | Recommended Improvement      |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Data Scope**      | Single timepoint | Longitudinal analysis        |
| **Control Factors** | None             | Include price, brand effects |
| **Mechanism**       | Correlation only | Causal inference methods     |

This analysis **establishes an association but not causation** between discounts and reviews. Future research should employ **controlled experiments** to isolate discount effects.
